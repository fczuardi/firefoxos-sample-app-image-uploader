Imgur Image Uploader App
==========================

A sample app for Firefox OS for uploading images to imgur.


Usage of Web APIs
=================

This application was made to demonstrate the usage of webactivities. It can act as an activity handler for the *share*
activity and it uses the *pick* activity to select images to be uploaded when launched as an app instead of being selected
as an adctivity from the share menu.

Google Summer of Code
=====================

This app was created as a part of a collection of sample apps for Firefox OS during Google Summer of Code 2013.
